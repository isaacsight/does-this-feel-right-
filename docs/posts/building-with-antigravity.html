    <h1>Building This Blog with Antigravity: A Meta Reflection</h1>

    <p><strong>Full disclosure:</strong> This blog—the one you're reading right now—was built in a single session with
    Antigravity, Google's AI coding assistant.</p>

<p>Not "helped by." <em>Built by.</em> With me as the director, not the developer.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>I started with a simple idea: I wanted a place to share essays that felt right. Minimalist. Intellectual. A space for
    thoughts that didn't fit in 280 characters.</p>

<p>I told Antigravity what I wanted. It asked clarifying questions. Then it started building.</p>

<p>Here's what we created in one evening:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Custom Static Site Generator</strong> - Python-based, clean and minimal</li>
    <li><strong>User Accounts</strong> - Real authentication via Supabase</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Libraries</strong> - Save posts, add private notes</li>
    <li><strong>Reading Progress Tracking</strong> - Automatic "Read" badges</li>
    <li><strong>Email Notifications</strong> - Auto-send to all users when I publish</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Domain Deployment</strong> - Live at doesthisfeelright.com</li>
</ul>

<p>Total time: About 4 hours. Total lines of code I wrote myself: Zero.</p>

<h2>What This Means</h2>

<p>I'm not a professional developer. I know enough Python to be dangerous, enough HTML to be annoying. But I had an idea
    and I had access to a tool that could turn ideas into reality.</p>

<p>This is the future we're walking into: <strong>Creation without credentials.</strong></p>

<p>You don't need to know how to code to build a platform. You need to know what you want to say and how you want to say
    it. The implementation becomes a matter of good communication, not technical skill.</p>

<h2>The Collaboration</h2>

<p>Working with Antigravity wasn't like using a tool. It was like pair programming with someone who:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Never gets tired</li>
    <li>Never judges your changing requirements</li>
    <li>Instantly researches best practices</li>
    <li>Implements features in minutes, not days</li>
</ul>

<p>But here's what was interesting: <em>I still had to know what I wanted.</em></p>

<p>The AI didn't decide the site should be minimal. I did. It didn't choose the intellectual aesthetic. I did. It didn't
    write these essays. I did.</p>

<p>Antigravity gave me leverage. But I provided the vision.</p>

<h2>Long-Term Goals for This Blog</h2>

<p>Now that the platform exists, here's what I'm building toward:</p>

<h3>1. Consistent Publishing</h3>
<p>At least one essay per week. Maybe more. The infrastructure is there—now I need to show up with ideas.</p>

<h3>2. Community Building</h3>
<p>The user accounts and email notifications aren't just features. They're the foundation of a community. People who
    save posts are signaling interest. People who add notes are thinking deeply. I want to nurture that.</p>

<h3>3. Evolving the Platform</h3>
<p>This is v1. Future ideas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Comments or discussion threads</li>
    <li>Reader submissions</li>
    <li>Curated collections</li>
    <li>Audio versions of essays</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Exploring AI-Assisted Creation</h3>
<p>I'm curious about the boundaries. Can I use AI to help research? To structure arguments? To challenge my thinking?
    Where does collaboration become plagiarism? I want to work this out in public.</p>

<h3>5. Transparency</h3>
<p>I'll continue to be open about how this site was built and how I use AI. This post is step one. More to come.</p>

<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>This blog is one small example of what's possible when creation tools become accessible. But it raises questions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If anyone can build anything, what becomes valuable?</li>
    <li>Is the <em>idea</em> the new code?</li>
    <li>What skills matter when technical execution is commoditized?</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't have all the answers. But I'm excited to explore them here.</p>

<h2>Join Me</h2>

<p>If you haven't already, create an account and save this post. You'll get an email every time I publish something new.
    No spam, no ads, just essays.</p>

<p>Because the real test isn't whether I can build a platform. It's whether I can build something worth reading.</p>

<p>Let's find out together.</p>
