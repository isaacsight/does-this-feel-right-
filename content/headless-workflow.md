We just spent the morning iterating on how to manage this blog. It was a perfect example of how developer tools evolve—and where they are going.

## The Evolution of Friction

### Phase 1: The Terminal Mess
At first, I was managing everything manually.
- One terminal tab for `python -m http.server`.
- Another for `git`.
- Another for editing files.
- **Result**: I had 6+ orphaned processes running in the background and constantly had to `kill` ports. It was messy.

### Phase 2: The TUI (Site Manager)
To fix this, we built a custom **Site Manager** TUI.
- It had a dashboard.
- It had buttons to Start/Stop the server.
- It had a log viewer.
- **Result**: It was better, but it was still *another tool* I had to manage. I had to navigate tabs, press keys, and deal with UI glitches (like mouse clicks not working).

### Phase 3: Going Headless
Then we realized something important: **I don't want to manage the server. I just want the server to work.**

So we deleted the UI.

Now, I have a "Headless" workflow. I simply tell my AI assistant:
> "Make a post about X"
> "Publish my changes"

The AI handles the processes, the git commands, and the file edits in the background. I don't see a terminal. I don't see a dashboard. I just see the results.

## Why This Matters
This is the future of interfaces. We often build GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) because we need a way to control complex systems. But if we have an intelligent agent that understands our *intent*, the best UI is no UI at all.

I'm not clicking buttons anymore. I'm just creating.
