<p>Indigenous people met ships; we met screens. Both encounters shattered worlds that weren’t ready for
    the intruders.</p>

<p>We are not "evolving into social media." We were ambushed by it.</p>

<p>Here is the clean, powerful connection you’re reaching for — the psychological and cultural parallel
    between Indigenous peoples encountering outsiders for the first time and modern people encountering
    social media for the first time (and now living inside it).</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Sudden Exposure to a New "World"</h2>
<h3>Indigenous first contact:</h3>
<p>Entire new technologies, behaviors, beliefs, and power structures appear almost overnight —
    unfamiliar, overwhelming, and often wrapped in promises or threats.</p>

<h3>Social media:</h3>
<p>We suddenly encountered a digital world with its own rules, languages, social hierarchies, and
    incentives. It feels natural now, but it was an alien environment introduced extremely fast.</p>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Correlation:</strong> We are not "evolving into social media." We were ambushed by it.
</blockquote>

<h2>2. Psychological Shock</h2>
<h3>Indigenous first contact:</h3>
<p>The brain had no framework to understand outsiders. This produced awe, fear, fascination, and
    vulnerability.</p>

<h3>Social media:</h3>
<p>The human nervous system had no evolutionary template for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Infinite attention streams</li>
    <li>Algorithmic reinforcement</li>
    <li>Digital status systems</li>
    <li>Parasocial relationships</li>
    <li>Dopamine farming</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Correlation:</strong> Both experiences cause cultural shock + psychological overwhelm
    because the system being introduced wasn’t designed for the people receiving it.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>3. Power Imbalance</h2>
<h3>Indigenous peoples:</h3>
<p>One group arrives with superior tech, weapons, navigation, and information control. The imbalance
    leads to manipulation, dependency, or loss of autonomy.</p>

<h3>Social media platforms:</h3>
<p>Companies arrive with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Supercomputers</li>
    <li>Behavioral science</li>
    <li>AI persuasion</li>
    <li>Algorithmic control</li>
    <li>Data extraction</li>
</ul>
<p>Humans become the "resource."</p>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Correlation:</strong> The ones who "arrive" choose the rules. The ones who "receive" lose
    control without realizing it.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>4. Identity Disruption</h2>
<h3>Indigenous communities:</h3>
<p>First contact disrupts tradition, roles, stories, cosmology, social bonds, and spiritual meaning.</p>

<h3>Social media:</h3>
<p>We experience:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identity fragmentation</li>
    <li>Comparison culture</li>
    <li>Digital personas</li>
    <li>Loss of community roots</li>
    <li>Collapse of shared meaning</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Correlation:</strong> First contact destabilizes identity — whether it’s a tribe or a
    timeline.
</blockquote>

<h2>5. Storytelling Becomes the Battleground</h2>
<h3>Indigenous peoples:</h3>
<p>Colonizers bring new stories about what is valuable, who is powerful, and how society should be
    ordered. These stories overwrite local ones.</p>

<h3>Social media:</h3>
<p>Algorithms decide what you see, what counts as "success," and what is worth caring about. Your
    internal story gets overwritten.</p>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Correlation:</strong> The fight is always over narrative sovereignty.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>6. Adoption → Dependency</h2>
<h3>Indigenous peoples:</h3>
<p>New tools and items (metal, cloth, medicine) create dependence on the outsiders.</p>

<h3>Social media:</h3>
<p>We become dependent on validation, digital identity, online community, and the phone as
    memory/extension of self.</p>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Correlation:</strong> What starts as curiosity becomes dependency.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>7. Loss of Autonomy</h2>
<h3>Indigenous peoples:</h3>
<p>First contact often leads to systemic loss of land, culture, and sovereignty.</p>

<h3>Social media:</h3>
<p>We lose attention, boundaries, privacy, and agency.</p>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Correlation:</strong> The more we take in, the more is taken from us.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>The Core Idea</h2>
<p>Social media is our "First Contact." We are the indigenous minds unprepared for the arrival of a new
    civilization — the digital one.</p>

<p>We didn’t meet an app. We met a new species of intelligence (algorithms) with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No morality</li>
    <li>No culture</li>
    <li>No memory</li>
    <li>Only goals</li>
</ul>

<p>We are still trying to figure out how to be human under these conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
    “We are the Indigenous psyche visited by the algorithmic colonizer.”
