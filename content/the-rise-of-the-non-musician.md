For all of human history, to make music, you had to move your hands.

You had to press a key, pluck a string, or strike a drum. The barrier to entry was physical dexterity. If you couldn't move your fingers fast enough, the music stayed in your head.

**That barrier is gone.**

AI is doing for music what photography did for painting. It is decoupling the *idea* from the *execution*.

## The New Instrument
We are about to see a new generation of musicians who cannot play a single note. They won't know music theory. They won't know how to read sheet music.

But they will have **taste**.

When the technical barrier drops to zero, taste becomes the only differentiator. The "non-musician" is simply a composer who uses a different instrument. Their instrument is not a piano or a guitar; it is a model.

## The Flood
Critics say this will lead to a flood of garbage. They are right. But it will also lead to a flood of genius that was previously trapped behind a lack of dexterity.

Think of the writer who has a symphony in their head but no years to learn the violin. Think of the director who can hear the score but cannot orchestrate it.

They are about to be unlocked.

## The Shift
We are moving from an era of *performance* to an era of *curation*. The artist of the future is not necessarily the one who can play the fastest, but the one who can choose the best.

The non-musician is rising. And the music they make might just be the most interesting thing we've heard in years.
