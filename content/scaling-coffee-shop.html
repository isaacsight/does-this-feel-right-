title: How to Scale a Coffee Shop (The Alex Hormozi Way)
category: Business Strategy
excerpt: Stop selling commodities. Start selling Offers. A guide to applying the Value Equation to your local cafe.
---
<p>Most coffee shop owners are stuck in the "commodity trap." They sell a $5 latte that costs $4.50 to
    make (after rent, labor, and beans), and they compete with 10 other shops on the same block doing
    the exact same thing.</p>

<p>If you want to scale, you have to stop selling coffee. You have to start selling
    <strong>Offers</strong>.
</p>

<p>Here is how you apply Alex Hormozi’s ($100M Offers, $100M Leads) frameworks to a coffee shop to
    dominate your local market.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. The Value Equation</h2>
<p>Hormozi’s core formula for value is:</p>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort &
        Sacrifice)</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>To scale, you need to maximize the top and minimize the bottom.</p>

<h3>The "Old" Coffee Shop Model:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dream Outcome:</strong> "I get caffeine." (Low value)</li>
    <li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> "It might be good, might be burnt." (Medium)</li>
    <li><strong>Time Delay:</strong> "I have to wait in line for 10 mins." (High pain)</li>
    <li><strong>Effort:</strong> "I have to drive there, park, and order." (High pain)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The "Hormozi" Coffee Shop Model:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dream Outcome:</strong> "I am instantly productive, energized, and treated like a VIP."
    </li>
    <li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> "They have 500 5-star reviews and a 'Love it or it's Free'
        guarantee."</li>
    <li><strong>Time Delay:</strong> "My order is ready the second I walk in."</li>
    <li><strong>Effort:</strong> "They know my name and my 'usual'. I don't even have to take out my
        wallet."</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>2. Create a "Grand Slam Offer"</h2>
<p>Stop selling single transactions. Create an offer so good people feel stupid saying no.</p>

<h3>Offer A: The "Unlimited Caffeine Club" (Recurring Revenue)</h3>
<p>Instead of hoping people come back, lock them in.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Offer:</strong> Unlimited drip coffee + 20% off all food/specialty drinks.</li>
    <li><strong>Price:</strong> $29/month.</li>
    <li><strong>Why it works:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guaranteed Revenue:</strong> You get paid whether they show up or not.</li>
            <li><strong>Habit Formation:</strong> They will <em>never</em> go to a competitor because
                they already "paid" for your coffee.</li>
            <li><strong>Upsells:</strong> Once they are in the door for their "free" coffee, they buy a
                muffin (high margin).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Offer B: The "Productivity Power-Up" (Bundle)</h3>
<p>Target the remote workers who camp out for 4 hours buying one tea. Monetize them.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Offer:</strong> "The Remote Work Pass"</li>
    <li><strong>Includes:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Premium Drink of choice.</li>
            <li>1 Pastry or Sandwich.</li>
            <li>Reserved "Quiet Zone" seating for 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Guaranteed High-Speed WiFi Code (separate bandwidth).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Price:</strong> $25/day (Value stacked to look like $50+).</li>
    <li><strong>Why it works:</strong> You turn a "loiterer" into a high-ticket customer.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>3. Get More Leads ($100M Leads)</h2>
<p>You need traffic. Waiting for foot traffic is dying.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Warm Outreach (Reciprocity):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Walk to every office within 2 blocks.</li>
            <li>Drop off a "Free Office Fuel Pack" (Box of coffee + pastries).</li>
            <li><strong>The Catch:</strong> Leave a stack of coupons for "First Month of Unlimited Club
                for $1" for their employees.</li>
            <li><em>Hormozi Principle: Give value first.</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Content (Authority):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't just post latte art. Post "How to make the perfect pour-over at home."</li>
            <li>Become the local coffee authority.</li>
            <li>Show the "Behind the Scenes" of your roasting process to increase perceived value.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>4. Raise Your Prices</h2>
<p>Most shops are afraid to raise prices. You shouldn't be, <strong>IF</strong> you increase value.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you implement the "No Wait" guarantee (mobile order dedicated lane), you can charge $7 for a
        latte instead of $5.</li>
    <li>People pay for <strong>speed</strong> and <strong>convenience</strong> (Time Delay and Effort),
        not just beans.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary: The Shift</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Stop selling commodities.</strong> Sell outcomes (energy, productivity, status).</li>
    <li><strong>Create recurring revenue.</strong> Subscriptions > One-off sales.</li>
    <li><strong>Stack value.</strong> Add guarantees, speed, and exclusivity to justify higher prices.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Go get customers.</strong> Don't wait for them to walk by.</li>
</ol>
