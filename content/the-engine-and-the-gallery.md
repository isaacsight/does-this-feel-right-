excerpt: Why we are decoupling the signal from the noise, and how Substack powers the studio while the site preserves the art.

We have spent the last few days stripping this website down to its studs. We removed the login systems, the databases, and the noise. We replaced them with something simpler, yet infinitely more powerful: **Substack**.

This wasn't just a technical migration. It was a philosophical decision about how this studio operates.

## The Engine: Substack
Substack is the engine. It is where the signal is generated and distributed. It is the "live" wire.

For a studio, the most important asset is the direct connection to the audience. Algorithms are fickle; email is forever. By moving our subscription and newsletter infrastructure to Substack, we ensure that:
1.  **The Signal is Owned:** We are not renting an audience from Twitter or LinkedIn.
2.  **The Friction is Zero:** It is the easiest way for you to read, listen, and reply.
3.  **The Network is Alive:** We tap into a broader ecosystem of thinkers and writers.

## The Gallery: This Website
If Substack is the engine, this website is the gallery.

Substack is linear; it flows like a river. But a studio needs a place where ideas can stand still, be curated, and be explored non-linearly. That is what `doesthisfeelright.com` is for.

*   **It is the Archive:** A permanent home for the essays that stand the test of time.
*   **It is the Aesthetic:** A controlled environment where the design (typography, spacing, silence) reinforces the message.
*   **It is the Hub:** The central point that ties together the newsletter, the projects, and the vision.

## The Loop
The strategy is simple:
1.  **Write** on Substack to reach you where you are.
2.  **Curate** on the Website to build a body of work that lasts.
3.  **Iterate** on both to find what feels right.

This dual structure allows us to move fast (sending emails) without breaking things (the website remains a static, stable artifact). It is the best of both worlds: the speed of a newsletter and the prestige of a publication.

Welcome to the new operating system.
