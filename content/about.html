<p>The internet is a noise machine.</p>

<p>Infinite scrolling. Clickbait headlines. Dopamine loops. It is designed to distract you, not inform
    you. It treats your attention as a resource to be mined, not a gift to be respected.</p>

<p><strong>Antigravity is different.</strong></p>

<p>It is a quiet place for loud ideas.</p>

<p>We believe that one deep insight is worth more than a thousand hot takes. We believe in slowing down
    to understand the systems that shape our world—from the mechanics of business to the psychology of
    culture.</p>

<ul>
    <li>No ads.</li>
    <li>No algorithms.</li>
    <li>No fluff.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just the signal.</p>

<p>Smart analysis for curious minds.</p>
