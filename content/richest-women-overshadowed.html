title: There Are Richest Women—But They're Often Overshadowed
category: Economics & Society
excerpt: Women make up just 13-15% of billionaires. A data-driven look at why they are less visible in the media.
---
<p>First off, we <em>do</em> hear about the richest women in the world, but they're far less prominent
    in headlines, pop culture, and everyday conversations compared to their male counterparts like Elon
    Musk or Jeff Bezos. This isn't an accident—it's rooted in systemic gender inequalities in
    wealth-building, media biases, and societal norms.</p>

<p>As of 2025, women make up just 13-15% of the world's 3,000+ billionaires (about 406 out of 3,028),
    with their combined wealth totaling around $1.5 trillion versus men's $10+ trillion. Here's a
    breakdown of why they're less visible, backed by data and analysis.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Fewer Women at the Top (The Numbers Don't Lie)</h2>
<p>Simply put, there are dramatically fewer ultra-wealthy women, so they're less likely to dominate the
    news cycle. In 2025:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only 15% of the top 100 richest people are women, with their average net worth ($39 billion)
        trailing men's ($52 billion).</li>
    <li>The share of female billionaires has grown (up 42% since 2010), but it's still shrinking as a
        percentage because men's numbers are exploding faster, especially in tech.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Inheritance vs. Self-Made: Less "Rags-to-Riches" Drama</h2>
<p>Male billionaires often get endless coverage for their "self-made" stories—think Musk's SpaceX
    launches or Bezos's Amazon empire. But 75-90% of female billionaires inherited their fortunes (from
    fathers or husbands), compared to just 8% of men.</p>

<p>Media loves underdog tales, so inherited wealth gets framed as "less interesting" or even "unearned,"
    reducing buzz. Of the top 10 richest women in 2025, only 1-2 are fully self-made.</p>

<p>Why the inheritance skew? Billionaire families are 65% more likely to have sons who carry on the
    legacy, and women historically face barriers to building empires from scratch.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Structural Barriers: The System Stacks the Deck</h2>
<p>Wealth accumulation isn't a level playing field. Women earn 77-82% of men's wages globally, have less
    access to venture capital (VC firms fund men 2-3x more often), and juggle disproportionate family
    responsibilities—leading to career "opt-outs" or slower climbs. Key hurdles:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk Aversion & Bias:</strong> Women are socialized to be more risk-averse and face
        "unconscious bias" in male-dominated fields like tech (60% of male billionaires' source). Men
        get bigger bonuses and lead mixed teams more often.</li>
    <li><strong>Networks & "Glass Cliffs":</strong> Limited access to mentors/sponsors, plus women are
        often promoted into risky "glass cliff" roles that amplify failure.</li>
    <li><strong>Longevity on Lists:</strong> Self-made women drop off billionaire rankings faster than
        men, per survival analyses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Result? Fewer women in high-visibility industries like tech or finance, where fortunes (and media
    spotlights) explode.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Media & Cultural Bias: Out of Sight, Out of Mind</h2>
<p>Even when women <em>are</em> billionaires, coverage skews toward men. Stories about female tycoons
    often focus on family drama or philanthropy over business acumen, while men's get the "visionary
    genius" treatment. Tech bros dominate feeds because their sectors (e.g., AI, EVs) are "sexy" news;
    inherited retail or cosmetics fortunes? Less clickbait. Plus, with 90% of billionaires male,
    algorithms and editors prioritize them.</p>

<p>Self-made standouts like Oprah Winfrey ($3B, media) or Taylor Swift ($1.6B, music) get more airtime
    because their stories buck the trend.</p>

<p>Progress is happening—female billionaire numbers are up 6x since 1995—but closing the gap could take
    generations without dismantling biases in funding, pay, and media.</p>
