<h2>1. Negativity is the strongest attention magnet</h2>
<p>People stop scrolling when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>someone messed up</li>
    <li>someone got caught</li>
    <li>someone exposed something</li>
    <li>someone failed publicly</li>
</ul>
<p>Platforms learn this pattern and keep feeding it because it maximizes watch time.</p>
<p>It’s not that people are more irresponsible — it’s that irresponsibility is highly clickable.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Algorithms overrepresent the edges, not the middle</h2>
<p><strong>Real life:</strong> most people live in the middle — responsible, average, decent.<br>
    <strong>Online:</strong> extremes dominate.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The most chaotic couple</li>
    <li>The worst breakup</li>
    <li>The most irresponsible parent</li>
    <li>The most reckless driver</li>
    <li>The dumbest take</li>
    <li>The wildest night out</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the edges perform better than the center, the center becomes invisible.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. “Irresponsibility content” is cheap and infinite</h2>
<p>You don’t need production.<br>
    You don’t need skill.<br>
    You don’t need art.</p>
<p>Just:</p>
<ul>
    <li>film someone acting dumb</li>
    <li>expose a bad choice</li>
    <li>rant about someone letting you down</li>
    <li>or share a personal disaster story</li>
</ul>
<p>This is content anyone can make, instantly.<br>
    So it fills the feeds.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Responsibility is quiet; irresponsibility is noisy</h2>
<p>You don’t see:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the millions of people waking up early every day</li>
    <li>the parents doing everything right</li>
    <li>the couples communicating well</li>
    <li>the creators building something with discipline</li>
</ul>
<p>That stuff doesn’t go viral because it’s quiet.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Irresponsibility triggers reaction — which fuels the algorithm</h2>
<p>People comment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>“Wow what an idiot”</li>
    <li>“This is so dumb”</li>
    <li>“I can’t believe they did this”</li>
    <li>“Bro no way”</li>
</ul>
<p>High comment velocity = algorithm boost.</p>
<p>So platforms accidentally reward the lowest behavior.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What This Means For You</h2>
<p>If you feel like:</p>
<blockquote>
    “Everything online is stupid, reckless, low-level, and chaotic”
</blockquote>
<p>…it’s not because you’re cynical.<br>
    It’s because your brain is picking up the algorithm’s bias toward maximum emotional response.</p>
<p>This is important:</p>
<p><strong>👉 You live in a world optimized for attention, not truth.</strong></p>
<p>So you see irresponsibility not because it’s everywhere — but because it sells.</p>
