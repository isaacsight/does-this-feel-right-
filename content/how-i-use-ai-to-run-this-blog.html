title: How I Use AI to Run This Blog
---

I don't just use AI to **write** this blog. I use it to **run** it.

Not in the abstract, philosophical sense. In the literal, mechanical sense.

Let me show you what that looks like.

---

## The Traditional Way

**Without AI:**
- Write a post in Markdown
- Save it to a file
- Run `python build.py`
- Commit to git
- Push to GitHub
- Wait for deployment
- Check for bugs
- Repeat

**With AI (how most people use it):**
- Ask AI to draft a post
- Copy/paste into a file
- Do all the manual steps above

**With AI (how I actually use it):**
- Tell it: "Write a post about X and publish it"
- Done.

---

## What the AI Actually Does

When I say "publish a post about X", here's what happens:

1. **Writes the content** - Drafts the essay in my voice
2. **Formats the metadata** - Sets title, tags, date, excerpt
3. **Saves the file** - Writes to `content/filename.html`
4. **Runs the build** - Executes `build.py` to regenerate the site
5. **Commits to git** - Adds, commits with a message
6. **Pushes to GitHub** - Deploys to production
7. **Verifies** - Checks that it's live

All of this happens in **seconds**.

---

## The Admin Dashboard

The AI also built me a **local admin panel**. 

I type `./start_admin.sh`, and I get a dark-mode interface where I can:
- Write posts in Markdown
- Set metadata (title, tags, category, date)
- Click **Publish** → Everything deploys automatically

No terminal commands. No git. No build scripts.

It feels like Substack, but I **own the platform**.

---

## Real Examples from Today

### Example 1: "Fix the sorting"
**Me:** "Organize the posts by most recent date first and add a filter so users can sort them."

**AI:** 
- Updated `build.py` to add `data-date` attributes
- Modified `main.js` to add sort logic
- Added UI controls to `index.html`
- Styled the buttons in `style.css`
- Built, committed, pushed

**Time:** ~2 minutes

### Example 2: "Why aren't recent posts at the top?"
**Me:** "Both are still at the bottom."

**AI:**
- Debugged the issue (found quotes around dates)
- Fixed the frontmatter in two files
- Rebuilt and redeployed

**Time:** ~1 minute

## The Workflow in Practice

Here's what a typical session looks like:

**Me:** "Add a Collections page so readers can browse by topic."

**AI:**
1. Creates `templates/collections.html`
2. Creates `templates/tag.html` for individual tag pages
3. Updates `build.py` to parse tags and generate pages
4. Adds CSS for the collections grid
5. Deploys everything

**Me:** "The tag links are broken."

**AI:**
1. Checks the generated HTML
2. Finds the issue (wrong root path)
3. Fixes `build.py`
4. Rebuilds and deploys

**Me:** "Perfect."

This back-and-forth happens in **minutes**, not hours.

---

## What Makes This Different

Most people treat AI like a **consultant**:
- "Can you help me with X?"
- AI gives advice
- You do the work

I treat it like a **coworker**:
- "Do X"
- AI does it
- I review and iterate

The difference is **execution authority**.

I don't ask the AI "how should I build this?"  
I tell it "build this."

---

## The Mental Shift

The hardest part isn't the tools. It's the **trust**.

You have to trust that:
- The AI will write correct code (mostly)
- The AI will catch its own mistakes (usually)
- The AI will follow your intent (with clear instructions)

And when it doesn't, you have to be willing to say:
- "That's wrong, fix it."
- "Try a different approach."
- "Revert that change."

It's not magic. It's **collaborative iteration at machine speed**.

---

## The Limits

What the AI **can't** do:
- Decide what to build (that's on me)
- Know what I want without clear instructions
- Understand subjective taste (I still choose the design)
- Replace domain expertise (I review everything)

What the AI **can** do:
- Implement my ideas faster than I could alone
- Catch bugs I would miss
- Refactor code I would avoid refactoring
- Deploy changes I would procrastinate on

The AI is not **better** than me. It's **faster**.

---

## Why This Matters

If I can build and run a blog this way, what does that mean for:
- **Indie hackers** building SaaS products?
- **Writers** who want custom platforms?
- **Designers** who want to prototype without waiting for devs?

The bottleneck isn't **ideas** anymore. It's **willingness to collaborate with AI**.

The tools are here. The workflows exist.

The question is: **Are you using AI as a tool, or as a teammate?**

## Try It Yourself

If you want this workflow:
1. Get an AI coding assistant (Antigravity, Cursor, v0, etc.)
2. Be specific about what you want
3. Review what it builds
4. Iterate until it's right
5. Deploy

You'll be shocked at how fast you can move.

The future of building isn't **no-code**. It's **conversation-driven code**.
