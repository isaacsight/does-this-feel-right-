<p>There are two ways to use AI.</p>

<p>You can use it to <strong>do things</strong>. Or you can use it to <strong>think about things</strong>.</p>

<p>Most people only use it for the first. They're missing the real power.</p>

<h2>The Execution Model</h2>

<p>When I need to <strong>build</strong> something, I use Antigravity (Google's AI coding assistant).</p>

<p>It's fast. It's precise. It writes code, debugs issues, and deploys changes in seconds.</p>

<p>This is the "doing" layer. It's transactional. I tell it what to build, and it builds it.</p>

<p>But before I can tell it <em>what</em> to build, I need to figure out <em>why</em> to build it.</p>

<p>That's where Claude comes in.</p>

<h2>The Thinking Model</h2>

<p>When I need to <strong>figure out</strong> something, I use Claude.</p>

<p>Not for code. For <strong>strategy</strong>.</p>

<p>Here's an example from this blog:</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> "Should I add an email subscription feature, or is that too pushy for a personal blog?"</p>

<p><strong>Claude:</strong> Breaks down the tradeoffs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Email gives you ownership of the audience</li>
    <li>But it adds friction and expectation</li>
    <li>Consider: Are you writing to build an audience, or to think out loud?</li>
    <li>If the former, email is essential. If the latter, RSS is better.</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn't code. This is <strong>thinking</strong>.</p>

<p>Claude doesn't just answer the question. It helps me <strong>ask better questions</strong>.</p>

<h2>Real Example: The Collections System</h2>

<p>I wanted readers to browse posts by topic. My first instinct was: "Add tags."</p>

<p>But before jumping into implementation, I asked Claude:</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> "What's the best way to organize 6-10 essays for easy browsing?"</p>

<p><strong>Claude's response (summarized):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Tags work, but they fragment the experience if you have too many</li>
    <li>Categories are simpler but less flexible</li>
    <li>Hybrid approach: Use categories as primary navigation, tags as secondary filters</li>
    <li>Consider: Do readers want to "explore by theme" or "find a specific topic"?</li>
</ul>

<p>This helped me realize I didn't just need tags. I needed a <strong>Collections page</strong> with a grid layout where
    readers could see all topics at a glance.</p>

<p>Then I went to Antigravity and said: "Build a Collections page with a grid of tags, each showing post count."</p>

<p>Antigravity built it in 2 minutes.</p>

<p>But the <strong>thinking</strong> that led to that decision? That took 10 minutes with Claude.</p>

<h2>The Division of Labor</h2>

<p>Here's how I use both:</p>

<p><strong>Claude (Thinking):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>"What features should I prioritize?"</li>
    <li>"How should the navigation flow work?"</li>
    <li>"What's the user mental model for this?"</li>
    <li>"Is this feature aligned with my goals?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Antigravity (Execution):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>"Add a sorting feature to the homepage"</li>
    <li>"Fix the date formatting bug"</li>
    <li>"Deploy the new Collections page"</li>
    <li>"Update the CSS for the glassmorphism header"</li>
</ul>

<p>Claude helps me <strong>decide what to build</strong>. Antigravity helps me <strong>build it fast</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why Claude for Strategy?</h2>

<p>Claude has a different personality than ChatGPT or Antigravity.</p>

<p>It's more <strong>Socratic</strong>. It asks follow-up questions. It challenges assumptions.</p>

<p>When I say: "I want to add dark mode," ChatGPT says: "Here's how to implement it."</p>

<p>Claude says: "Why? Who's your audience? Are they developers who expect dark mode, or general readers who might find
    it confusing?"</p>

<p>It makes me <strong>justify my decisions</strong> before I make them.</p>

<p>This saves me from building features I don't actually need.</p>

<h2>The Meta Layer</h2>

<p>The real unlock is using AI to think <strong>about how to think</strong>.</p>

<p>Example: I was stuck on whether to make this blog personal or professional.</p>

<p><strong>Me to Claude:</strong> "Should I write in a polished, editorial voice or a casual, conversational one?"</p>

<p><strong>Claude:</strong> "What's the purpose of the blog? If it's to build authority, polish matters. If it's to
    develop ideas in public, authenticity matters more. What do you want readers to take away?"</p>

<p>This forced me to clarify: <em>I'm not building a media brand. I'm thinking out loud.</em></p>

<p>That realization shaped everything: the tone, the design, the lack of SEO optimization.</p>

<p>Without Claude, I would have built a blog that <em>looked</em> professional but <em>felt</em> wrong.</p>

<h2>The Workflow</h2>

<p>Here's my actual process:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Idea Phase:</strong> Talk to Claude about what I'm trying to achieve</li>
    <li><strong>Strategy Phase:</strong> Claude helps me break down the problem and weigh tradeoffs</li>
    <li><strong>Execution Phase:</strong> Antigravity builds what we decided on</li>
    <li><strong>Iteration Phase:</strong> If something feels off, back to Claude to rethink the approach</li>
</ol>

<p>This loop is <strong>fast</strong> but <strong>thoughtful</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm not just shipping features. I'm shipping <em>the right features</em>.</p>

<h2>The Difference</h2>

<p>Most people treat AI like a <strong>tool</strong>: "Do this task for me."</p>

<p>That works for execution. But it doesn't work for strategy.</p>

<p>Strategy requires <strong>conversation</strong>. It requires being challenged. It requires saying "I don't know" and
    working through it.</p>

<p>Claude is designed for that. It doesn't just give answers. It thinks <em>with</em> you.</p>

<h2>Try It</h2>

<p>Next time you're building something, try this:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Before you start coding, spend 10 minutes with Claude asking "why"</li>
    <li>Ask it to challenge your assumptions</li>
    <li>Let it ask <em>you</em> questions instead of just giving answers</li>
    <li>Then—and only then—switch to your execution tool and build</li>
</ol>

<p>You'll be surprised how much clearer your decisions become.</p>

<p>And you'll waste a lot less time building things you didn't actually need.</p>

<p>Because the best code is the code you <strong>don't have to write</strong>.</p>
