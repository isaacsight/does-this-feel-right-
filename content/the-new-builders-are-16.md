excerpt: Teenagers aren't just using Google's Antigravity to cheat on homework. They're building products that feel like magic, and they're doing it for fun.

I watched a 16-year-old build a fully functional social network in an afternoon.

He didn't know React. He didn't know SQL. He just knew what he wanted to make, and he had Google's Antigravity open in a tab.

For the last decade, we've been told that "learning to code" was the literacy of the 21st century. We pushed Python on middle schoolers and gamified JavaScript logic. We treated coding like a trade skill—something you learn so you can get a job at a big tech company and optimize ad algorithms.

But the teenagers using Antigravity aren't trying to get a job. They're trying to manifest an idea.

## The Death of Friction

When I was learning to build software, 90% of the friction was syntax. It was setting up the environment, debugging a missing semicolon, or figuring out why the CSS grid wasn't aligning. The "idea" part was small; the "execution" part was massive.

Antigravity inverts this. The execution is trivial. The idea is everything.

I see teenagers using it not as a crutch, but as a bicycle for the mind (to borrow a phrase). They are skipping the "Hello World" phase and jumping straight to "Hello Universe."

They are building:
*   Apps to coordinate local protests.
*   Games that remix their friends' inside jokes.
*   Tools to analyze their own Spotify data in ways Spotify won't allow.

They aren't "software engineers." They are builders. And they are having more fun than any senior developer I know.

## Play as the Ultimate R&D

The most interesting products have always come from play. Linux started as a hobby. Facebook was a college prank. The personal computer itself was a toy for hobbyists.

When you lower the barrier to entry to zero, you unlock a flood of "unserious" ideas. And unserious ideas are often the ones that change the world, because they aren't constrained by business models or quarterly goals.

These teenagers aren't worried about scalability or unit tests. They are worried about whether it *feels right*. They are optimizing for delight, for shock value, for utility in their specific, small social circle.

## The New Literacy

The literacy of the future isn't syntax. It's systems thinking. It's the ability to describe a problem clearly enough that an AI can solve it.

The teenagers I see using Antigravity are becoming master architects. They know how to chain logic, how to structure data, and how to iterate. They are learning the *essence* of engineering without the *pain* of coding.

They are reminding us of something we forgot along the way: building things is supposed to be fun.

We spent years trying to turn everyone into a coder. Antigravity is turning everyone into a creator. And the kids are alright.
